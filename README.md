# Job Listing Application

This is a full-stack job listing application that uses Django REST Framework for the backend and Vite with React and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. The application scrapes job data from Dice.com using a Scrapy spider and stores it in a MySQL database. The frontend fetches job details from the backend and displays them in a user-friendly interface.
